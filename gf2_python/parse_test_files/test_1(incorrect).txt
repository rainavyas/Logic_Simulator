Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.
